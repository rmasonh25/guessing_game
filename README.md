# Guessing Game

This is a simple command-line number guessing game written in Rust, based on the official Rust book [*The Rust Programming Language*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.

Your goal: **guess the number** in as few tries as possible.

After each guess, youâ€™ll be told whether the secret number is higher or lower than your guess â€” until you get it right.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have Rust installed. Then run:

```bash
cargo run
